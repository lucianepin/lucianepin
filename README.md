- 👋 Hi, I’m @lucianepin (call me Lu Pinheiro)
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming an entrepreneur (food, tech, sustainability)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning technical storytelling techniques, Infra Modernization GTM, Cloud capabilities, AI tools
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI (industry cases) projects
- 📫 How to reach me (send me a DR: lucianepin@gmail.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: She
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm working on getting accustomed to GitHub as a community platform —it's not the easiest to navigate for interactions. I'm hopeful that I’ll connect with people who share similar interests! 🙂
